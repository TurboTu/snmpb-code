How to build a binary rpm for snmpb
------------------------------------

1- log in a root
2- cd SPECS
3- rpmbuild -bb snmpb.spec

This will build the package and create a .rpm 
file in the local RPMS/i386 directory.

This will install the package by default in /usr.
Change the _prefix value in the spec file to change this.

Note: to install the package, cd RPMS/i386 then, as root, 
issue the command: rpm -i snmpb-x.x.x.i386.rpm
